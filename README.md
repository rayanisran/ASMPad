# ASMPad
ASMPad is an C# IDE for 65c816 Assembly intended to streamline writing code for Super Mario World ROM hacking, released under the MIT License. It features the following:

* Embedded ROM/RAM Maps, Command Prompt, and Hex Editor. The hex-editor doesn't revert changes to files like Translhexation does and it can show and jump to SNES addresses as well.
* Multi-file support (tabbed interface).
* Customizable syntax highlighting, tooltips, templates and code snippets.
* ASM/IPS patching with the ability to make a backup of the file beforehand.
* Code completion for definitions which can be from a text file, the current document or both.
* Macro recording and playback, bookmarks, ability to comment/uncomment code regions and more.
* Assemble file function which reports all errors, highlights the lines and shows a tooltip when those lines are clicked much like Visual Studio.
* Utilities such as SNES/PC address conversion, easy searching of opcodes, sound effects and player poses.
* And much more!
